Welcome andrius-siup,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. The last update to this file was: **July 2, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

# Deployment

The website was developed using Gitpod workspace to commit and push to GitHub. The project uses GitHub for hosting and has been deployed using Heroku.
To access to my page please follow these steps:

## Requirements

* Gitpod or Visual Studio Code
* PIP - install packages in Python.
* stripe - create an account for online payments.
* AWS - create an account cloud storage(create a S3 bucket) for online backup of website static files.
* git - version control system of code source.

## Download

* Navigate to my repository https://github.com/andrius-siup/cherry-on-the-cake.git .
* Click the **Code** button.
* Click the **Download Zip**.
* Extract where you want to keep all files.

## Clone Repository

* GitHub navigate to **andrius-siup/cherry-on-the-cake**.
* Click the **Code** button.
* To clone with **HTTPS** copy the URL in the box https://github.com/andrius-siup/cherry-on-the-cake.git
* Open your Git Bash.
* Changed the directory to the location you want to clone to be made.
* Type git clone than paste the copied URL  `git clone https://github.com/andrius-siup/cherry-on-the-cake.git` .
* Enter and your local clone will be created.

## Creating an Environment File

Install Requirements.txt file, in your terminal type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` . Next you will need to create **env.py** file for storing sensitive data,
type `touch env.py` in terminal. This file should never be pushed to GitHub, so type `touch .gitignore` to be able to ignore it. Than open the **.gitignore** file and lets
ignore your **env.py** file typed:

```bash
 env.py 
__pycache__/
```

save and close it.

In the env.py file we need to hide several bits of data. Open env.py file and type:

```bash
import os

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "********")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "********")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "********")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "********")
```

Replace the secret keys with your own values from your accounts:

* The SECRET_KEY can be generated from the [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) .
* The STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and the STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY:
  * Sign In stripe.com > Developers > API keys > and you will find the keys.
* The STRIPE_WH_SECRET > Sign In stripe.com > Developers > Webhooks > Add endpoint( run server > copy the URL and add at the end 'checkout/wh/') > than open up the Webhook Deatils page with Signing key.

Make sure that your env.py file isn't being tracked, type  `git status` and make sure that you can not see it listed.

Or you can store environment variables in Gitpod > Settings > Variables > Environment Variables:

```bash
'DEVELOPMENT', 'True'
'SECRET_KEY', '<copy from Django Secret Key Generator>'
'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '<copy Stripe Public key>'
'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '<copy Stripe Secret key>'
'STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '<copy the Webhook Secret key>'
```

In the settings.py change the DEBUG mode.

```bash
DEBUG = True 
```

Set up the local database by running those commands:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser for the database, in order to access Django administration page.

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

And followed the instructions create admin: input name, email, password and repeat the password.

Start your server by typing:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Deployment to Heroku

To deploy the app using Heroku, use the following steps:

1. Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) page and login.
1. Create new app by click on **New** and **Create New App** . Enter your unique app name, select your region and than click **create app**.
1. Than find the Resources tab and install the addon Heroku Postgres.
1. To be able to read Heroku environment variables go to **Settings**  than click on **Reveal Config Vars** .
1. Add the following variables:

    ```bash
      KEY 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' VALUE '<your value>'
      KEY 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' VALUE '<your value>'
      KEY 'DATABASE_URL' VALUE 'Heroku added aytomaticly'
      KEY 'SECRET_KEY' VALUE '<your value>'
      KEY 'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY' VALUE '<your value>'
      KEY 'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY' VALUE '<your value>'
      KEY 'STRIPE_WH_SECRET' VALUE '<your value>'
      KEY 'USE_AWS' VALUE 'True'
    ```

1. Migrate the database:

    ```bash
    python3 managa.py makemigrations
    python3 managa.py migrate
    ```

1. Create a superuser for the database, in order to access Django administration page.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

1. Install Green unicorn, which will act as our webserver:

    ```bash
    pip3 install gunicorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

1. Create a new Procfile file to tell Heroku create the web dyno:

    ```bash
    web: gunicorn x_cherry.wsgi:application
    ```

1. Push all changes in the Github
1. In the Heroku page, go to Deploy tab and choose the deployment method Github.
1. Enter your Github link and choose the Automatic Deployments, enable every commit to push directly to Heroku.



## The secret key was accidentally pushed to the repo

* Removed the secret key from settings.py
* Generate the new one key here [Random django key]("https://djecrety.ir/")
* store that key in gitpod settings environment variables as SECRET_KEY
* in settings.py set the key like this `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')`

## The Stripe Issues

* sometimes accidentally Gitpod will change app URL and it doen't match the Stripe endpoint. When I saw the stripe error it will fix it easily change the  stripe endpoint.
